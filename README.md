# ArzioLib
#### Provides API for Bukkit plugins to interact with Crafting Dead objects and a ton of customizable addons and fixes for your Crafting Dead server.

This plugin still needs more documentation, including a better README file.  
If you want to help with it, you are welcome.

Check for releases at the [releases page](https://github.com/Arzio/ArzioLib/releases).
